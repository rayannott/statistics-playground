    "Two players, **A** and **B**, play Russian roulette as follows:  \n",
    "- A revolver contains exactly one bullet in its six chambers.  \n",
    "- On each turn, the current player spins the cylinder (randomly shuffling the bulletâ€™s position) and then pulls the trigger.  \n",
    "- The probability of dying on any given turn is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).  \n",
    "- Players take turns in sequence, starting with Player **A**.  \n",
    "- The game continues until one player dies, at which point the surviving player wins.  \n",
